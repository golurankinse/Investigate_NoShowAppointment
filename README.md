# No-show-appointments

## Introduction
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment. <br>
‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital. <br>
‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família. <br>
Be careful about the encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.
